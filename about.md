This site is not an official website of Te Ra School but is simply a way to make this proposal available to other parents. 

The proposal on these pages is the outcome of a many discussions with Kapiti Waldorf Trust members and other members of relevant school bodies but it is at this stage simply a proposal.

This website was set up, independently of Te Ra School by a group of interested parents.

If amendments to the current wording can be agreed, our request would be that the Kapiti Waldorf Trust, the Board of Trustees and the College of Teachers take this proposal up as the living document in the Strategic Plan, the Charter and the future branding of the school.
