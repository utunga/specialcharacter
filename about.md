After a year of discussion, we, as parents, felt that the time had come to get specific about what direction we think the school needs to move in if we are to bring unity, community and celebration back to our school. 

Our proposal is made in the form of suggested changes to the one page ‘Special Character’ guiding principles document as this is a straightforward document to work with. 

If amendments to the current wording can be agreed, our request would be that the Kapiti Waldorf Trust, the Board of Trustees and the College of Teachers take it up as the living document in the Strategic Plan, the Charter and the future branding of the school.
